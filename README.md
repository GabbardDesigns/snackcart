Snackcart

Purpose: POS system for a snack cart   
User: Children with developmental disabilities (limited reading and math skills)

Functional Requirements
Students must be able to click (touch) items to add them to the shopping order.  
A total must be presented to students and be used to help them understand how much is needed to be paid.  
There must be a way to reset the register once the transaction is completed. 
Nice to Have
Pay options/Pay Aid - Graphical interface to track payment received and show students how much they still need to receive.
Overpayment/Refund - The system should help students determine if change is needed and how much.  
Design Considerations
The intended use case for this solution is on a tablet or laptop in widescreen layout.  For this reason, portrait and phone configurations are a secondary consideration.
Distribution
The initial version will be a web-based application with a set inventory.  
Future Improvements
The full version of this application will be deployed on Android and iOS mobile devices using react-native and react-fs.  This version will feature an admin interface that will allow users with the admin code (a set code initially, changeable within the admin interface) to:
Add new inventory items
Change the name, price, etc of items
Manage the availability of inventory (by marking active or inactive)
